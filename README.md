# ITBootcamp_Final_Project
This is the final project of a IT Bootcamp course that took place online, from April to mid June 2022. 
The project is a small representation of what I managed to learn at the course.
I used Java to test various features of the demo website designed for QA (https://demoqa.com/) over the 5 days time frame. 
Considering this was my first ever project, there were series of challenges. However, I am extremely happy how it turned out in the end.
I will continue to test other features of the website, because I really believe that I learned a lot by doing this project.
# Project test cases
These are the cases that I automated in Java.
